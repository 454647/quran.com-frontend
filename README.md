## Beta.Quran.com
This is the project soon to be the Quran.com facing site. This is built in
Reactjs + Flux (Fluxible by Yahoo) + Expressjs + Webpack. It is isomorphic (javascript shared
between both the server and the client) for SEO reasons.

#### Getting started
Simply clone this repo, then run `npm install` to install all the required node_modules.
From there, you are ready to go! To start the app, run `npm run watch` which will
run both the server and the client (webpack) to compile upon edits. In fact,
hot-module has been added that components will update without the need to refresh
the page.

#### Tests
Install karma and karma command line:
```
npm install -g karma
npm install -g karma-cli
```

#### Backend
Currently, the repo is on private. Contact me to require access.

#### How to contribute
Fork this repo, then create a PR for specific fixes, improvements, etc. We trust that
you will not steal this, this is at the end of the day for the sake of Allah and we
all have good intentions while working with this project. But I must stress, stealing
this is unacceptable.

#### Design
We currently use InvisionApp. Again, contact me if you'd like access to it.
